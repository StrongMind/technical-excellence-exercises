# Technical Excellence Exercises

## How to use

This repository has exercises in subdirectories.

For Ruby and Python exercises, run `make install` in the directory the exercise is in. These should work on a Mac with homebrew and a recent python or ruby installed. It is left as an exercise for the reader to get those working in windows.

For C# exercises, restore nuget packages to install relevant libraries. These should work in Visual Studio on Windows and Rider on a Mac using .NET 6.0.
