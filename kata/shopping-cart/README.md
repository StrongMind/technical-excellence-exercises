# Shopping Cart Kata

In this kata, you will implement the business domain objects/models for a simple shopping cart, driven by tests.

Each of the language folders contains a starting project in order to start with.

Implement the following functionality :

* A Product has a price and a cost.
* A Cart can hold many products.
* A Cart knows how to total the Products that it holds.
* A Product may be discounted in bulk (e.g It costs $5, but buying 3 costs $12)
* A Product may be added in any order, and the discounts will still apply if several of them are present.
